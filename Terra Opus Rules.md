### Do not share your account information with others

Any rules broken under your account, even if someone else is using it, will result in the appropriate punishment. If we find you were using another account to break rules, the main account will be punished too

### Do not attempt to circumvent a punishment

Your ability to play or chat on our Minecraft servers have been revoked (as a punishment) because you have broken the rules. If the punishment was temporary, our assumption is that by revoking these abilities will encourage you to follow the rules in the future, when the punishment expires. Bypassing the punishment will not serve to encourage you to follow the rules in the future. This will result in a similar punishment to that account

### Do not use hacks / client side cheats (Includes external software like autoclickers, or cheats you can do in vanilla, like X-Ray resource packs, etc...)

You can use Quality of Life mods, like Performance enhancing mods, minimaps, schematics, but not cheats, because they provide a unfair advantage over the players who don't use them

### Do not intentionally lag the server

This creates a unplayable experience for everyone

### Do not sell in game items for Real life money

This includes selling items for crypto-currency

### Do not exploit bugs

These bugs usually harm both the players and the server itself. If you find any bug, please report it!
